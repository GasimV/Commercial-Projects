# AzeriAI-Suite

Welcome to the AzeriAI-Suite, a comprehensive suite of AI models tailored for the Azerbaijani language. This project includes models for speech recognition, a GPT-based language model, and text-to-speech, all developed to enhance Azerbaijani language processing. Our goal is to provide robust, language-specific tools for natural language understanding and generation.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken Azerbaijani into text with high accuracy.
- **GPT-based Language Model**: Generate contextually relevant Azerbaijani text and perform a variety of NLP tasks.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Transform Azerbaijani text into clear, natural-sounding speech.

Each component is designed to work standalone or integrated into various applications, enhancing accessibility and interaction for Azerbaijani-speaking users.
