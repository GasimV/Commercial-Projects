## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this Proof-of-Concept is to explore how **advanced machine learning** can optimize **supply chain operations**, specifically in:

* **Reorder prediction** – estimating the likelihood a customer will reorder a SKU within a defined time window.
* **Quantity forecasting** – predicting the expected order volume at the next purchase.
* **Opportunity ranking** – generating actionable priority scores for sales, category, and inventory teams.

These capabilities help Veyseloğlu improve **stock management, demand planning, sales forecasting, and operational efficiency** across its vast distribution network.
