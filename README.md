## Project 1: Intent Recognition for Document Retrieval

**Description**: This project aims to build an intent recognition system to assist citizens applying to a government agency to receive specific types of documents through an automatic machine with a built-in voice assistant. The model recognizes the intentions of citizens based on their spoken requests and determines the type of document they intend to receive.

**Technologies Used**:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Python
- Voice Assistant Integration

**Highlights**:
- Developed using a dataset in the Azerbaijani language
- Utilized classical Machine Learning models like KNN and Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Employed multiple evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Integrated with voice assistants to provide a seamless user experience
